                    <h3>Indications and Usage for GluViva</h3>
                    <p>GluViva is an injectable insulin analog indicated to improve glycemic control in adults and children with type 1 diabetes mellitus and in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Administer GluViva once daily. Take at the same time every day.</p>
                    <p>GluViva is long-lasting insulin and not recommended for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. Instead, use intravenous short-acting insulin. </p>
                    <h2>Important Safety Information for GluViva</h2>
                    <h3>Contraindications</h3>
                    <p>Patients who are hypersensitive to insulin rybrawnol or one of its excipients should not take GluViva.</p>
                    <h3>Warnings and Precautions</h3>
                    <p>All patients taking insulin should have their blood glucose monitored. Insulin regimens should be modified cautiously and only under the supervision of a medical professional. A change in insulin dose or an adjustment in concomitant oral antidiabetic treatment may be needed as a result of changes in insulin strength, manufacturer, type or method of administration.</p>
                    <p>Do not mix or dilute with any other insulin or solution. If mixed or diluted, GluViva may become cloudy. This may affect the onset of action and alter the time to peak in a manner, making it difficult to predict. Severe hypoglycemia can occur if GluViva is administered with an insulin pump or intravenously. Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of insulin therapy and may be life-threatening.</p>
                    <p>Patients must not share insulin devices and needles.<br />
                    Severe life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur.</p>
                    <p>Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may require a reduction in their GluViva dose.</p>
                    <h3>Drug Interactions</h3>
                    <p>Certain drugs may affect glucose metabolism and may require an insulin dose adjustment along with close blood glucose monitoring. Patients taking anti-adrenergic drugs, such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine and resperine, may experience reduced signs of hypoglycemia.</p>
                    <h3>Adverse Reactions</h3>
                    <p>Other adverse reactions commonly associated with GluViva are injection site reaction, lipodystrophy, pruritus and rash.</p>
                    <!--<p>In clinical studies in adult patients there was a higher incidence of treatment-emergent injection-site pain (1.4% GluViva vs. 0.7% NPH). The reports of pain at the injection site were usually mild and did not result in discontinuation of therapy. </p>
                    <h3>Important Safety information for GluViva simplePlan pen</h3>
                    <p>GluViva simplePlan is a prefilled, disposable insulin pen. Patients should follow each step in the instruction pamphlet included with the pen to help ensure an accurate dose every time. If instructions are not followed properly, patients risk taking an incorrect amount of insulin. This may affect their blood glucose. </p>-->
